FRC 2012 Vision Sample Program
--------------------------------
This project is a camera vision sample that detects the 4 rectangles that are the 2012 FRC game
vision targets. Look at the comments in the code and the Vision white paper published in the
documents section of the WPILib project on firstforge.wpi.edu. Look in the VisionImages directory
inside the project that is created for the sample images as well as the NI Vision Assistant file
that contains the vision command chain (open it with the Vision Assistant)
