FRC Default Program (Current with imaging tool)
--------------------------------

This program is the "default" main program included when imaging the cRIO with the
"default" code in C++.  

This demo uses the IterativeRobot base class in order to mirror the "old style" default
code (prior to 2009) by providing methods which are called by the main loop at the
appropriate times.

This demo is intended to provide functionality that will confirm the operation and usage
of the core control system components, as used in the "Benchtop Test" described in
Chapter 2 of the 2009 FRC Control System Manual.

This program provides features in the Disabled, Autonomous, and Teleop modes as described
in the "benchtop test" directions, including "once-a-second" debugging printouts when
disabled, a "KITT light show" on the solenoid lights when disabled, and elementary driving
capabilities and "button mapping" of joysticks when teleoperated.  This demonstration
program also shows the use of the user watchdog timer.

This demonstration is not intended to serve as a "starting template" for development of
robot code for a team, as there are better templates and examples created specifically
for that purpose.  However, teams may find the techniques used in this program to be
interesting possibilities for use in their own robot code.
