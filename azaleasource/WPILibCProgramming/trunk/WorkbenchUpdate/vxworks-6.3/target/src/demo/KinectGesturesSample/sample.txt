FRC Kinect Gestures Sample
--------------------------------
This program demonstrates robot side processing of the Kinect data
using C++. This program implements the same gestures that are in the
FRC Kinect Server and are described in the Getting Started with the
Microsoft Kinect for FRC document. This program maps the resulting
axes from each arm to tank drive at 1/3 power.
